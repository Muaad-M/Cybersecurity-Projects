## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Sentinel:** Cloud-native SIEM used to create and manage custom analytics rules, detect threats, and investigate incidents.
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE):** Provided endpoint telemetry, behaviour monitoring, and antivirus scanning during the simulation.
- **PowerShell:** Used to simulate adversarial behaviour by executing the `Invoke-WebRequest` command to download a safe payload (EICAR).
- **Kusto Query Language (KQL):** Employed to build precise queries for detecting suspicious PowerShell activity via `DeviceProcessEvents`.
- **Windows Virtual Machine (VM):** A simulated endpoint on which detection and response workflows were tested.
- **EICAR Test File:** Safe test file used to simulate malicious behaviour without real malware.
