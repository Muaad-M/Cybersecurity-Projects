# 04 - Automated Response

## Overview

Following the detection of the simulated Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) automatically initiated response actions. These actions are designed to contain the threat, preserve evidence, and enable efficient investigation and remediation. Automating this process significantly reduces the time between detection and containment, which is critical in minimising potential damage.

## Automated Actions Taken

### 1. Device Isolation

Once the custom detection rule was triggered, MDE automatically isolated the compromised virtual machine. This action severed the device’s network connectivity, effectively cutting it off from both internal systems and external command-and-control servers.

**Why Isolation Matters:**

- Prevents further lateral movement by the attacker.
- Stops any ongoing data exfiltration or payload delivery.
- Allows analysts to safely investigate without external interference.

During the isolation, I was still able to remotely interact with the device via MDE’s secure investigation tools.

### 2. Collection of Investigation Package

Simultaneously, MDE initiated the collection of an investigation package from the isolated VM. This package included a wide array of forensic artefacts:

- **Process Trees**: Helped visualise the sequence of actions that led to the attack, showing parent and child process relationships.
- **File and Registry Modifications**: Logged all file system and registry changes made during the attack window.
- **Network Activity**: Captured all network connections, including DNS requests and remote IP communications.
- **Event Logs**: Provided detailed logs of system-level activities during the time of the incident.

This package was available for download through the MDE portal, allowing me to conduct a thorough offline analysis.

## Reviewing the Action Center

All automated actions were documented in the **Action Center** within the MDE portal. This included:

- A timeline of when the device was isolated.
- Confirmation that the investigation package was collected.
- A clear link back to the detection rule that triggered the response.

Having this structured timeline helped me validate that the incident response workflow functioned as expected and ensured that no manual steps were overlooked.

## Restoring the Device

Once the investigation was complete and I was confident the threat had been neutralised, I used the **Release from Isolation** option in the portal. This action reconnected the VM to the network, restoring it to normal operation.

## Key Takeaways

- Automated response features in MDE significantly reduce the Mean Time to Contain (MTTC).
- Device isolation is a powerful tool for preventing threat propagation while preserving the integrity of evidence.
- Collection of forensic data at the point of compromise is invaluable for root cause analysis and reporting.
- Using the Action Center allowed me to track each response step with full transparency and control.

## Summary

This automated response phase showcased how well-configured detection rules in MDE can initiate containment and investigation workflows without manual intervention. This not only accelerates incident response but also reduces the risk of human error, making it a vital capability in any modern Security Operations Centre (SOC).
