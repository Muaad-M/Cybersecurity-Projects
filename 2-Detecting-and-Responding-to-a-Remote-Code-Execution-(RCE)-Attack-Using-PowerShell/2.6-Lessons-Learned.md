# 06 - Lessons Learned

## Strategic Insights

Conducting this end-to-end simulation of a PowerShell-based Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack provided me with valuable hands-on experience across multiple aspects of modern endpoint defence. This exercise not only tested my ability to configure detection logic but also challenged me to think critically about attacker behaviours, response mechanisms, and forensic validation.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. **PowerShell Is a Double-Edged Sword**

I observed first-hand how PowerShell, while powerful for system administration, can be equally leveraged by attackers for malicious purposes. The flexibility it offers in bypassing execution policies and operating without UI makes it a favoured tool for adversaries. This reinforced the importance of strict monitoring and detection rules around PowerShell use in enterprise environments.

### 2. **KQL Is a Powerful Language for Detection Engineering**

Crafting a custom KQL query helped me appreciate how effective Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's hunting capabilities can be. I learned to:

- Filter for precise behaviours using `has_all` and other operators.
- Understand which tables (e.g., `DeviceProcessEvents`) contain relevant telemetry.
- Translate adversarial tactics into logical, queryable patterns.

This significantly enhanced my understanding of detection engineering fundamentals.

### 3. **Custom Detection Rules Can Significantly Reduce Response Time**

By automating the response (isolation and evidence collection), I was able to contain the simulated threat within seconds of detection. This proved to me that proactive custom rules can play a vital role in improving an organisation’s incident response maturity, reducing dwell time, and freeing up analysts for higher-order tasks.

### 4. **Forensic Investigation Is Essential for Assurance**

Collecting and analysing the investigation package gave me the assurance that the simulated attack had been contained and allowed me to verify each step of the kill chain. It reinforced the importance of deep forensic review after any security event, even when automated tools have responded effectively.

### 5. **Simulation Testing Is Crucial for Defensive Confidence**

Executing a simulated attack allowed me to validate the end-to-end process — from detection to isolation to post-event analysis. It highlighted areas where I was strong and areas where I can still improve (such as faster correlation of artefacts across different log sources).

## Areas for Future Improvement

- I aim to expand my detection logic to cover other techniques often paired with PowerShell, such as `EncodedCommand`, obfuscation, or living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins).
- I will explore integrating third-party threat intelligence feeds to enrich detection context.
- I also plan to practise simulating post-exploitation scenarios (e.g., credential dumping or lateral movement) to build more comprehensive detection rules.

## Conclusion

This exercise deepened my practical understanding of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and sharpened my skills in detection engineering, automated response, and forensic analysis. It was a valuable reminder that effective cybersecurity hinges on a layered approach: understanding attacker techniques, building proactive detections, automating responses, and validating outcomes through forensic investigation.
