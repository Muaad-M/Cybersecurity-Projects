# 05 - Forensic Investigation

## Overview

After the simulated Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack was detected and automatically responded to by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), I proceeded with the forensic investigation. The goal was to analyse the collected data to understand the full scope of the attack, identify the techniques used, and ensure that the threat had been fully contained.

## Accessing the Investigation Package

The investigation package was automatically collected as part of the custom detection rule’s response actions. I accessed it through the **Action Center** in the MDE portal. This package included a comprehensive snapshot of system activity during the incident.

## Key Artefacts Analysed

### 1. **Process Trees**

Process trees revealed the sequence of events that led to the execution of the 7-Zip installer. By reviewing these trees, I was able to verify:

- The parent process was `cmd.exe`, which invoked PowerShell.
- PowerShell executed the `Invoke-WebRequest` command to download the installer.
- `Start-Process` was used to silently install the application.

This flow confirmed that the attack mimicked known PowerShell-based RCE techniques.

### 2. **File and Registry Changes**

I reviewed changes to files and registry keys made during the attack window:

- The downloaded executable (`7z2408-x64.exe`) was placed in `C:\ProgramData`, a commonly writable directory.
- Registry entries associated with 7-Zip were modified to reflect the installation.
- No persistence mechanisms or malicious registry keys were detected, indicating the payload was benign in this case.

### 3. **Network Connections**

The investigation package also provided detailed logs of network activity:

- Outbound connection was made to `sacyberrange00.blob.core.windows.net`, confirming the download source.
- No evidence of further outbound communication or command-and-control activity was found.
- This validated that the detection occurred early in the attack lifecycle.

### 4. **Event Logs**

System and security event logs helped me correlate activity with the exact time the command was executed:

- PowerShell logs showed the bypassed execution policy and loaded script command.
- Windows Installer logs indicated that the 7-Zip installation completed successfully.
- No errors or additional suspicious events were present, reinforcing that the simulation was self-contained.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Portal**: For navigating the Action Center and downloading the investigation package.
- **Event Viewer**: To further analyse local event logs on the isolated device.
- **Process Explorer**: To correlate process IDs and timelines.

## Findings

- The detection rule worked as intended, triggering on the specific command line behaviour.
- The attacker’s activity (in this simulation) was limited to downloading and executing a single installer.
- MDE successfully isolated the device, limiting any potential for post-exploitation activity.
- Forensic artefacts confirmed that the VM was not further compromised.

## Summary

The forensic investigation confirmed that the simulated RCE attack was fully contained and that no additional indicators of compromise were present. Analysing the investigation package provided crucial insights into the attack sequence, helping me validate both the detection and response strategies. This step reinforced the value of automated evidence collection and thorough post-incident analysis within a modern SOC workflow.
