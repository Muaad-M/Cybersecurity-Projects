# Tools Used

## Azure Portal

- **Purpose**: Managed and configured all resources, including Virtual Networks, Virtual Machines, Resource Groups, and Log Analytics Workspaces.
  
- **Key Features**: Centralised management of Azure resources, with an intuitive user interface for resource provisioning and monitoring.

## Azure Virtual Network (VNet)

- **Purpose**: Designed and deployed a Virtual Network to host the honeypot VM, ensuring secure traffic segregation between public and private-facing zones.
  
- **Key Features**: Subnetting and IP address management, traffic isolation, and custom security configurations.

## Azure Network Security Groups (NSG)

- **Purpose**: Configured inbound and outbound security rules to expose the honeypot VM to potential attacks, simulating a vulnerable environment for testing purposes.
  
- **Key Features**: Fine-grained control over network traffic, including source IP, port, and protocol-based security rules.

## Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM)

- **Purpose**: Deployed a Windows 10 VM as the honeypot to simulate vulnerabilities and allow for attack simulation.
  
- **Key Features**: Configured to accept all inbound traffic by disabling the firewall, facilitating attack simulations and security event logging.

## Azure Log Analytics Workspace (LAW)

- **Purpose**: Centralised platform for collecting and storing log data from Azure resources, enabling in-depth analysis of security events.
  
- **Key Features**: Integration with Azure Sentinel for advanced security monitoring and querying.

## Azure Sentinel

- **Purpose**: Used for centralized security monitoring and log analysis, with a focus on detecting and investigating security incidents.
  
- **Key Features**: SIEM solution for gathering and analysing security logs, creating queries using KQL (Kusto Query Language), and generating actionable insights.

## Kusto Query Language (KQL)

- **Purpose**: Used to query and analyse log data in Azure Sentinel to identify failed login attempts (Event ID 4625) and investigate potential threats.
  
- **Key Features**: Powerful querying capabilities for filtering, aggregating, and visualising log data within Sentinel.

## GeoIP Watchlist in Azure Sentinel

- **Purpose**: Enriched security event logs by adding geographical context to IP addresses, helping to better understand attack sources.
  
- **Key Features**: Imported GeoIP data to link with log data for enhanced security monitoring and visualisation.

## Azure Sentinel Workbook

- **Purpose**: Visualised security events and attack patterns, including the creation of an interactive attack map based on failed login attempts.
  
- **Key Features**: Customizable reports and dashboards, with visualizations like maps, graphs, and tables for easier data interpretation.

## GeoIP Data (GeoIP Watchlist)

- **Purpose**: Enhanced the security logs with geographical information related to the source of failed login attempts, providing further context for investigation.
  
- **Key Features**: Geographical lookup of IP addresses for more effective threat detection and response.
