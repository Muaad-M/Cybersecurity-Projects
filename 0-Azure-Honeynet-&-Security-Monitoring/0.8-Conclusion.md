## Project Outcome

### Key Skills Acquired

- **Azure Infrastructure Setup**: Gained hands-on experience in configuring and deploying a secure, scalable Azure environment, including setting up Resource Groups, Virtual Networks, and Virtual Machines.

- **Security Monitoring**: Learned how to configure security monitoring tools in Azure, including setting up Network Security Groups (NSGs) and integrating Azure Sentinel for log collection and real-time analysis.

- **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**: Developed proficiency in using KQL for querying security logs and investigating potential security threats, such as failed login attempts.

- **Log Analytics**: Improved ability to centralise, collect, and analyse security logs using Azure's Log Analytics Workspace to drive insights and proactive security measures.

- **GeoIP Enrichment**: Enhanced understanding of adding geographical context to security logs, allowing for better identification of attack sources based on geographical data.

### Key Achievements

- **Honeypot Deployment**: Successfully deployed a Windows 10 VM as a honeypot, configured to simulate a vulnerable environment by exposing it to potential attacks through customised security rules (NSG) and disabling the Windows Firewall.

- **Log Collection Setup**: Configured and integrated Log Analytics Workspace and Azure Sentinel for centralised log collection, focusing on failed login attempts (Event ID 4625), ensuring all relevant security data was captured for analysis.

- **Security Event Analysis**: Utilised Azure Sentinel to collect security logs, perform queries using KQL, and identify potential threats, enabling deeper insights into attack patterns and behaviours.

- **Attack Visualisation**: Leveraged KQL to create a geographical attack map that visualised the distribution of failed login attempts, enabling a more intuitive understanding of attack patterns across different regions.

### Summary

This project provided a solid foundation in cloud security and monitoring, offering practical experience with Azure services and tools used to detect, investigate, and respond to security threats. The integration of advanced features like GeoIP enrichment and attack visualisation enabled a multifaceted approach to analysing threat data, strengthening both technical skills and analytical thinking.
