## ðŸ“˜ Lessons Learned

- This project provided a valuable introduction to cloud security, and while I was able to configure core Azure components and get a working honeypot in place, I also encountered a steep learning curve in understanding how various services interconnectâ€”especially when setting up logging pipelines and configuring Sentinel correctly.

- Writing effective KQL queries took practice. Initially, I found it difficult to filter noise and focus on meaningful security events. However, experimenting with different query structures and reviewing documentation helped me develop a better understanding over time.

- Integrating GeoIP data for enrichment was more complex than anticipated. It taught me the importance of data formatting and consistency, and highlighted how enriched data can significantly enhance the value of threat insights.

- While creating the attack map visualisation was rewarding, I realised the importance of clarity and user experience in dashboards. Designing something intuitive yet informative took several iterations and revealed just how much thought goes into effective visual communication.

- One key takeaway was how essential it is to approach security with both a technical and analytical mindset. The technical setup alone doesnâ€™t guarantee value; interpreting the data meaningfully is what transforms raw logs into actionable intelligence.

- If I were to repeat the project, Iâ€™d invest more time upfront in understanding the underlying architecture of Azure Sentinel and Log Analytics. I also plan to explore alerting and automation features in future iterations to simulate a more real-world incident response workflow.

This project was a meaningful step forward in my cybersecurity journey, and while thereâ€™s still much to learn, I now feel more confident navigating cloud security tools and thinking critically about threat detection.
