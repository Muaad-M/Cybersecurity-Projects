## Project Outcomes

This project is a crucial part of my hands-on learning journey to enhance my cybersecurity skills. The main outcomes I aim to achieve through this project include:

- **Azure Infrastructure Setup**: I will gain practical experience in configuring and deploying a secure, scalable Azure environment. This includes setting up Resource Groups, Virtual Networks, and Virtual Machines, which will provide me with a strong foundation in cloud infrastructure.

- **Security Monitoring**: I will configure and integrate security monitoring tools in Azure, such as Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Sentinel. This will help me develop the skills needed to collect and analyse security logs, which are critical in identifying and responding to potential security threats.

- **Log Collection and Analysis**: By integrating Azure Sentinel with Log Analytics Workspace, I will centralize log collection from the honeypot VM. I will develop proficiency in using Kusto Query Language (KQL) to query logs and identify key security events like failed login attempts (Event ID 4625).

- **GeoIP Enrichment**: I will enhance my understanding of adding geographical context to security event logs through the use of GeoIP Watchlists in Azure Sentinel. This will allow me to better track the sources of potential attacks and improve my ability to detect attack patterns based on geographical data.

- **Attack Visualization**: I will create an interactive attack map to visually represent the distribution of failed login attempts. This will enable me to understand attack trends more intuitively and develop analytical insights into how security events are spread across different regions.

Through this project, I will strengthen both my technical skills in cloud security and my analytical thinking in threat detection and incident response. The integration of these tools and techniques will greatly enhance my cybersecurity knowledge and prepare me for real-world security challenges.
