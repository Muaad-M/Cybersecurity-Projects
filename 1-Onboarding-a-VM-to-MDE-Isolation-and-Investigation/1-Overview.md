# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) - VM Onboarding and Incident Response Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simulated hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) on a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM) hosted in Microsoft Azure. The goal is to showcase essential endpoint detection and response (EDR) practicesâ€”spanning VM deployment, onboarding to MDE, incident response, and forensic analysis. The lab environment was designed to reflect real-world cybersecurity operations in a cloud-based setting.

The project is broken down into four key sections, each representing a crucial part of the SOC analyst workflow.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Sections

### 1. [Onboarding Windows VM to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](./1.1-Onboarding-MDE/1.1-Document.md)
Covers the end-to-end process of provisioning a Windows 10 VM and securely onboarding it into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Includes environment setup, onboarding package deployment, and validation.

### 2. [Incident Response - Isolating VM and Forensic Analysis](./1.2-Incident-Response/1.2-Document.md)
Simulates a security incident by isolating the VM and remotely collecting an investigation package. Demonstrates how endpoint telemetry is gathered and analyzed during threat containment.

### 3. [Network Testing - Validating Isolation and Connectivity](./1.3-Network-Testing/1.3-Document.md)
Describes the methodology for testing VM network isolation using ICMP traffic and NSG rule manipulation to simulate threat exposure and containment.

### 4. [Skills Acquired and Cybersecurity Correlation](./1.4-Skills-Documentation/1.4-Document.md)
Details the technical and procedural skills acquired through the project. Each skill is mapped to its corresponding cybersecurity domain, highlighting relevance to real-world SOC roles.
