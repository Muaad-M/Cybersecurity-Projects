# Onboarding Windows VM to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)

## Objective
The goal of this phase was to successfully onboard a Windows 10 VM to MDE, enabling telemetry, threat detection, and endpoint visibility.

## Environment Setup
- **Platform Used**: Microsoft Azure
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 (Version 22H2)
- **VM Size**: DS1 v2 (1 vCPU, 3.5 GB RAM)
- **Region**: East US 2
- **Disk Type**: Standard HDD
- **Hostname**: Noble-Win10
- **Username**: Moonko
- **Security Measures**: A secure, complex password was created to ensure the VM was protected against unauthorized access.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Create the Windows Virtual Machine
A new VM was deployed using Azure's portal with a secure configuration. Proper sizing, region selection, and secure credentials were applied to ensure optimal performance and security posture.

### 2. Log into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) Portal
The portal was accessed via [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com), which provides device inventory, threat analytics, and management tools.

### 3. Navigate to the Onboarding Page
- Path: `Settings → Endpoints → Device Management → Onboarding`
This is the interface used to onboard devices into MDE.

### 4. Download the Onboarding Package
Due to lack of admin privileges, a pre-staged Windows 10/11 onboarding package was used: `Windows-10-and-11-GatewayWindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip`.

### 5. Install the MDE Package
The package was installed on Noble-Win10 under the Moonko account using administrative privileges. This ensured the service was properly registered with MDE.

## Outcome
The VM was successfully onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This enabled:
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Telemetry collection (processes, files, network connections)
- Centralized device visibility
