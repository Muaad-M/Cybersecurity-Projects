# Incident Response - Isolating VM and Forensic Analysis

## Objective
This section simulated a security incident by isolating the VM and capturing forensic artefacts. These exercises are representative of real-world incident response workflows.

## Part A – Isolating a Virtual Machine

### 1. Disable Firewall and Configure NSG
Accessed `wf.msc` to turn off the Windows firewall. The Network Security Group (NSG) was edited to allow ICMP traffic to validate live connectivity.

### 2. Start Continuous Ping
A separate host machine initiated a continuous ping to the VM's public IP.

### 3. Isolate the VM via MDE Portal
Via **Assets → Devices**, the VM was selected and isolated using the "Isolate device" feature. The ping failed shortly after, confirming isolation.

### 4. Release Isolation
After confirming the effects of isolation, the device was released to resume normal operation.

## Part B – Creating and Reviewing an Investigation Package

### 1. Generate Investigation Package
From the VM's page in the MDE portal, "Collect Investigation Package" was initiated with a contextual comment for traceability.

### 2. Monitor in Action Center
Progress was tracked through the Action Center until the package was ready for download.

### 3. Download and Analyze Package
The `.zip` package was extracted locally. Files such as `running_processes.txt`, `network_connections.txt`, and `startup_items.txt` were reviewed for system activity insights.

## Outcome
This phase demonstrated critical SOC skills such as network isolation and incident artefact collection. These tools allow remote containment and analysis of potential threats without needing physical access to the machine.
