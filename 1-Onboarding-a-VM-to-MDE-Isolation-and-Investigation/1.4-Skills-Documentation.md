# Skills Acquired and Cybersecurity Correlation

## Self-Reflection
This project significantly enhanced my understanding of endpoint management and incident response processes in a modern SOC environment. Configuring Azure resources, navigating the MDE interface, and executing key SOC workflows helped reinforce both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. The structured nature of the lab also encouraged careful documentation and analytical thinking, vital attributes for a SOC analyst.
