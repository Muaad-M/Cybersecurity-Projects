## ðŸ“˜ Lessons Learned

- This project deepened my understanding of endpoint protection in a cloud environment. While I successfully onboarded the VM into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, I initially underestimated the number of dependencies and permissions required to ensure full integration. Troubleshooting these issues taught me to be more methodical when dealing with Azure security configurations.

- Simulating an incident and isolating the VM gave me hands-on insight into how SOC teams respond to threats in real time. I found the process of collecting and reviewing forensic packages particularly informative, though interpreting some of the telemetry data proved challenging without additional contextâ€”which highlighted the importance of continuous learning in threat analysis.

- Testing network isolation using ICMP and NSG rules helped me better understand how network controls can be used to contain threats. I learned that even simple tools like ping can be powerful when verifying segmentation and isolation policies.

- Working with the MDE Action Center exposed me to the lifecycle of incident response actions. Initially, I was unclear about the different response options and their implications, but documenting each step helped clarify how these features support structured SOC workflows.

- Throughout the project, I recognised how critical it is to balance automation with manual analysis. PowerShell scripts were efficient for onboarding, but interpreting the output still required analytical thinking and attention to detail.

- If I were to improve anything, it would be dedicating more time to exploring MITRE ATT&CK mappings and better understanding how each simulated action fits into a broader adversarial model.

Overall, this project helped bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and operational practice. While I still have areas to improveâ€”particularly around advanced telemetry analysisâ€”I now feel more confident navigating MDE and approaching endpoint security from both a technical and procedural perspective.
