# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity lab portfolio — a hands-on collection of practical projects that simulate Security Operations Centre (SOC) workflows, cloud security implementation, threat detection engineering, and incident response practices using Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Sentinel, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

Each project reflects real-world security scenarios and showcases core competencies in cloud infrastructure, endpoint protection, detection logic, and digital forensics.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 🔸 [Azure Honeynet & Security Monitoring](https://github.com/Muaad-M/Cybersecurity-Projects/blob/main/0-Azure-Honeynet-%26-Security-Monitoring/0-Overview.md)
Simulated real-world attacks on an Azure-hosted Windows VM. Centralised logs in Microsoft Sentinel, used KQL for threat detection, and visualised attack paths using GeoIP and custom dashboards.

- Tools: Azure, Sentinel, KQL, GeoIP
- Skills: Network Security, Threat Detection, SOC Monitoring

### 🔸 [VM Onboarding to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), Isolation, and Investigation](https://github.com/Muaad-M/Cybersecurity-Projects/blob/main/1-Onboarding-a-VM-to-MDE-Isolation-and-Investigation/1-Overview.md)
Onboarded a Windows 10 VM into MDE and conducted a simulated SOC investigation—isolating a compromised endpoint and performing remote forensic collection.

- Tools: MDE, Azure VM, Action Centre
- Skills: Endpoint Security, Incident Response, Digital Forensics

---

### 🔸 [Detecting and Responding to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) Attack Using PowerShell](https://github.com/Muaad-M/Cybersecurity-Projects/blob/main/2-Detecting-and-Responding-to-a-Remote-Code-Execution-(RCE)-Attack-Using-PowerShell/2-Overview.md)
Simulated a PowerShell-based RCE attack, built a custom detection rule in MDE, automated the response, and reviewed the investigation package for post-exploitation activity.

- Tools: PowerShell, MDE, KQL
- Skills: Detection Engineering, Threat Response, Automation

---

### 🔸 [Brute Force Detection in Azure VMs Using Microsoft Sentinel](https://github.com/Muaad-M/Cybersecurity-Projects/blob/main/3-Brute-Force-Detection-in-Azure-VMs-Using-Microsoft-Sentinel/3-Overview.md)
Developed and deployed a KQL-based rule in Sentinel to detect brute force login attempts. Validated effectiveness through log analysis, threat correlation, and incident response.

- Tools: Sentinel, Log Analytics, KQL
- Skills: Detection Logic, MITRE ATT&CK Mapping, Post-Incident Reporting
