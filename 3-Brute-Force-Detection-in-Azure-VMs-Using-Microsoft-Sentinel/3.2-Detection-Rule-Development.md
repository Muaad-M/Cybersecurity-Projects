## Phase 1: Detection Rule Development

### Objective:  
The goal of this phase was to create a custom detection rule in Microsoft Sentinel aimed at detecting potential brute force login attempts targeting Azure virtual machines (VMs). The goal was to develop a rule that was lightweight, actionable, and proactive — one that could flag malicious activity early, before it escalated.

### Steps Taken:

1. **KQL Query Development**  
   To detect the brute force attempts, I needed to develop a Kusto Query Language (KQL) query capable of identifying repeated failed login attempts from the same IP to the same machine within a 5-hour window. This query would serve as the core of the detection rule.

   **KQL Query:**
   ```kusto
   DeviceLogonEvents
   | where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(5h)
   | summarize EventCount = count() by RemoteIP, DeviceName
   | where EventCount >= 10
   | order by EventCount
   ```
# Query Explanation and Rule Configuration in Microsoft Sentinel

## Explanation of the Query:

- **`DeviceLogonEvents`**: This table contains the login events from devices across the environment.
  
- **`ActionType == "LogonFailed"`**: Filters to show only failed login attempts. Successes are not relevant for brute force detection.
  
- **`TimeGenerated > ago(5h)`**: Restricts the data to the last 5 hours to focus on recent activity.
  
- **`summarize EventCount = count() by RemoteIP, DeviceName`**: Groups the data by the source IP address (`RemoteIP`) and the target device (`DeviceName`), counting the number of failed login attempts.
  
- **`where EventCount >= 10`**: If a specific IP address has failed to log in 10 or more times to the same device, it is flagged as suspicious.
  
- **`order by EventCount`**: Sorts the results by the number of failed attempts, highlighting the most aggressive sources first.

The query was designed to be highly focused, providing only the relevant signals of brute force behaviour and eliminating unnecessary noise.

## Rule Configuration in Microsoft Sentinel

After testing the query in Log Analytics, I proceeded to configure it as a **Scheduled Query Rule** in Sentinel. This rule would run every 4 hours to detect potential brute force attempts.

### Rule Configuration Details:

- **Rule Name**: Noble – Create Alert Rule (Brute Force Attempt Detection)
  
- **Severity**: Medium — indicative of a potential, but not immediately critical, threat.
  
- **Alert Grouping**: Enabled — this helped group events from the same source IP and target device, reducing alert noise.
  
- **Data Source**: DeviceLogonEvents — the primary data source for login events.
  
- **Mapped MITRE Techniques**:
  - **T1110 (Brute Force)**: The primary technique, which is the focus of this detection.
  - **T1087 (Account Discovery)**: Relevant as failed login attempts can indicate reconnaissance activity as attackers search for valid accounts.
  
- **Rule Frequency**: Scheduled to run every 4 hours — balancing between timely detection and resource use.

## Outcome:

The detection rule was successfully configured and deployed. It was capable of identifying brute force login attempts in real-time, running every 4 hours with minimal system overhead. The rule provided a proactive means of detecting suspicious login activity and alerting security personnel before the situation could escalate.
