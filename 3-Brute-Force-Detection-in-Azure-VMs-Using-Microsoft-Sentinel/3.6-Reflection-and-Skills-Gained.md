## Reflection and Skills Gained

### Professional Development Outcomes

This project provided a practical, end-to-end experience in threat detection, response, and post-incident handling using Microsoft Sentinel and related tooling. It demonstrated the importance of writing effective detection rules and validated the value of process-driven investigation.

### Key Skills Strengthened


| Skill Area                           | Description                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **KQL for Threat Detection**         | Built greater confidence writing and tuning KQL queries to identify common attack behaviours such as brute force attempts. |
| **Microsoft Sentinel Rule Authoring**| Gained practical experience setting up Scheduled Query Rules, including alert grouping and basic rule configuration. |
| **Incident Response Handling**       | Carried out structured incident response activities within Sentinel — from alert investigation to resolution. |
| **Threat Hunting via Log Analytics** | Developed the ability to navigate and analyse login activity using Log Analytics to trace potential threats. |
| **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Use** | Used Defender features to initiate endpoint scans and review basic security telemetry during investigations. |
| **Threat Intelligence Correlation**  | Learned to identify patterns across IPs and logs that could support enrichment or watchlist use.            |
| **Post-Incident Documentation**      | Practised summarising technical activity clearly and accurately for internal reporting and team reference.  |
| **Security Monitoring Familiarity**  | Strengthened understanding of how continuous log-based monitoring contributes to early threat detection.     |
| **Use of MITRE ATT&CK Framework**    | Gained familiarity with mapping alerts to MITRE techniques to better classify observed activity.             |

### Final Thoughts

This engagement validated the strength of layered security controls and proactive detection logic in preventing early-stage attacks. Through this project, I improved both my technical threat detection capabilities and my structured approach to incident response.

The ability to detect brute force attempts, confirm containment, and communicate confidently about the outcome is a key skill in any SOC environment. This exercise reinforced that detection without delay — and investigation without doubt — is essential in modern cyber defence.
