## ðŸ“˜ Lessons Learned

- Developing this detection rule deepened my understanding of balancing precision and coverage in threat detection. Writing a KQL query that was both performant and accurate required multiple rounds of testing and refinement to avoid unnecessary noise.

- One of the challenges I faced was tuning the detection logic to minimise false positives while still capturing meaningful activity. This process taught me how important it is to understand both the context of the environment and the behaviour of attackers when defining detection thresholds.

- Working with Scheduled Query Rules in Microsoft Sentinel gave me practical insight into how timing and frequency impact detection visibility. I also learned how alert grouping can streamline triage, especially when multiple attempts originate from the same IP.

- Investigating the incident after detection underscored the importance of layered security. While Sentinel surfaced the brute force activity, validating the integrity of endpoints via Defender for Endpoint provided essential assurance that no compromise had occurred.

- I gained a better appreciation for the post-incident process, particularly how structured documentation and analysis support knowledge sharing and operational maturity within a SOC environment.

- In hindsight, I would explore integrating threat intelligence enrichment (e.g., using watchlists or external IOCs) earlier in the process. This could improve the contextual relevance of alerts and help prioritise response efforts.

This project reinforced the importance of proactive monitoring, accurate detection engineering, and thorough incident response. It also highlighted the need for continual tuning and validation in any detection strategy to keep pace with evolving threats.
