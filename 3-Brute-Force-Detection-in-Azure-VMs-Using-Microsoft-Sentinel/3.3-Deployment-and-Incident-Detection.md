## Deployment and Incident Detection

Once the query was tested and fine-tuned in Log Analytics, the next step was to deploy it as a **Scheduled Query Rule** in Microsoft Sentinel. This ensured that the rule would run automatically, detecting brute force attempts on a regular schedule.

**Deployment Steps:**
- I validated the query within Log Analytics to ensure it was functioning correctly.
- The query was then converted into a **Scheduled Query Rule** within Sentinel, set to execute every 4 hours. This scheduling allowed for timely detection of brute force attempts without overloading the system.
- The rule was configured with **alert grouping enabled**, which would group similar events by the same source IP and target device to reduce noise and improve the effectiveness of alert management.

### 2. **Alert Triggered**

Once the rule was deployed and operational, it wasn't long before the first alert was triggered. The rule successfully flagged repeated failed login attempts from the same IP addresses to various Azure virtual machines within the 5-hour window. The grouping feature worked as intended, consolidating multiple failed attempts into a single, actionable alert.

**Key Details:**
- The alert provided insights into the IP addresses involved, the target devices, and the number of failed login attempts.
- With the **Alert Grouping** feature, it was easy to identify patterns and see which IP addresses were attacking multiple devices, helping to streamline the investigation process.

### 3. **Taking Ownership of the Incident**

Once the alert was generated, I took immediate ownership of the incident in Sentinel. The first step was to assess the situation, determine the scope of the attack, and investigate further.

- **Initial Assessment**: I reviewed the alert and identified the source IP addresses involved in the failed login attempts.
- **Investigation Map**: I used Sentinelâ€™s **Investigation Map** to visualise the connection between the IP addresses and the affected devices. This provided clarity on which machines were being targeted and allowed me to prioritise the most affected systems.
  
The use of the **Investigation Map** was key to quickly understanding the scope of the attack and making informed decisions on the next steps.

### 4. **Further Investigation with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**

After identifying the affected devices, I switched over to **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** to carry out additional checks. This integration allowed me to pull up the affected VMs and check:
- Recent activities and events on each VM.
- Logged-in users.
- Any signs of compromise or unusual behaviour, as indicated by the **risk exposure score** and device health status.

I performed a quick investigation into these areas to assess whether the attack had led to any system compromise.

### 5. **Running Antivirus Scans**

To confirm that there were no malicious artifacts on the affected devices, I initiated **Quick AV Scans** directly from Defender for Endpoint. Thankfully, all scans returned clean results, confirming that no malware or suspicious files had been found on the machines.

---

## Outcome:

- The rule was successfully deployed and triggered as expected, generating alerts for repeated failed login attempts.
- I took ownership of the alert, investigated the situation using the **Investigation Map** and **Defender for Endpoint**, and confirmed that no compromise had occurred.
- **AV scans** were run as an additional precaution, and all systems were confirmed to be free of malware.

The successful detection, investigation, and confirmation of no compromise showed that the rule was effective in identifying brute force attempts early, helping to ensure the environment remained secure.
